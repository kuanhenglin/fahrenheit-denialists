**What to expect:** <br>
Our project is a 3d graphics demo of the famous study girl from lofi hip hop radio – beats to relax/study to. When you start up the scene you will see the study girl sitting in her chair just vibing to the chill beats. On her desk is a laptop, a notebook, and a study lamp. To her right is a window looking out to the night sky with a purring cat on the windowsill. We hope that our scene with give you the motivation to get though finals! Everything seems calm and peaceful until you realize the underlying physics engine that Jordan created. <br>

In the options menu below you can change the gravity to be in any of the coordinate axes, and watch chaos ensue! The table’s legs with quickly break off, the computer and notebook will go flying, and the study girl will go flying in any which direction you choose.
